General Inforamtion
==========
This website is a website for the Relay for Life philanthropy. It was designed by Andrew Nolan, and all content was done by contributing authors in the group. Everyone contributed an awesome amount of content and effort; definitely a project well-worth doing.

Technical Information
==========
The technical information about this site is pretty straightforward. We first start out with the brickwork of the entire website: a responsive framework. That is provided by the <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> framework. This means you may browse our website on anything from an iPhone to a 65" television and your viewing quality will not be degraded! 
From there, we see that our index features a slider with large images with the most relevant content. This is the Flexslider plugin, using the thumbnail features and a few other clever little js and css functionalities.
Featured also on all pages is our footer(responsive of course), with a general bit of information and also information on the latest walks that Relay for Life will be performing
